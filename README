Trying to beat the market


Looking to use an ensemble to predict stock prices or wether to buy/sell and beat the market


gen 1
Time horizon 1 day
XGB predicting exact prices - 5/10. Got some results but ultimately
it failed to generalize and struggled with large datasets due to
outliers(even with different eval functions). It potentially read 
too much into the numbers rather than the change.

gen 2
XGB predicting %price change - 8/10. Much better generalization,
I think the main reason for this is that it doesn't worry about
the current price at all and only focuses on finding the % change.
Also began passing the month and day of the week(they have a 
relatively low F score). No returns on modern markets: time to 
mix it up.

gen 3
scraping my own data using yfinance. Starting with russell 3000. 
Exloring adding the following to the data - more lag collumns,
label earnings dates/dividend dates, moving averages, PE ratio,
sector, and/or any other indicator I can come up with.
